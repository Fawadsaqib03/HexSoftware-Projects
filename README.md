## ✅ Task 1 – Beginner Python Practice  
This was my **first task** in the internship, focused on exploring Python basics and applying them to simple data operations.  

### 🔹 What I Did  
- Practiced coding logic in Python  
- Implemented beginner-friendly problem-solving techniques  
- Built a strong foundation for upcoming tasks  

### 🛠️ Technology Used  
- Python 3 (Jupyter Notebook)  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## ✅ Task 2 – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression  
This was my **second task**, where I worked on a **Machine Learning project** involving house price prediction.  

### 🔹 What I Did  
- Explored and cleaned the dataset (removed duplicates, irrelevant attributes)  
- Applied normalization techniques for consistency  
- Split dataset into training and testing sets  
- Built and evaluated a **Linear Regression Model**  
- Visualized results to interpret predictive performance and outcomes  

### 🛠️ Technology Used  
- Python 3 (Jupyter Notebook)  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## ✅ Task 3 – Loan Eligibility Prediction (Classification Models)  
This was my **third and final task**, where I built a system to predict **loan eligibility** based on applicant details.  

### 🔹 What I Did  
- Performed **data cleaning & preprocessing**  
  - Handled missing values using **mode & mean imputation**  
  - Encoded categorical features (Gender, Married, Dependents, etc.)  
  - Created new features such as **TotalIncome** and **Log-transformed income**  
- Split dataset into training and testing sets  
- Trained and compared two **Machine Learning models**:  
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**  
  - **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
- Evaluated the models using **accuracy score**  
  - Decision Tree Accuracy → **~70%**  
  - Naive Bayes Accuracy → **~77%**  
- Applied the trained model to **new test data** and generated loan eligibility predictions  

### 🛠️ Technology Used  
- Python 3 (Jupyter Notebook)  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib  
- Models: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes
